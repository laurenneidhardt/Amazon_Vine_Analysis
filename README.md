## Amazon Vine Analysis

### Overview of the analysis: 
  The purpose of this analysis is to see if there is any bias in reviews based on whether or not customers were paid for their feedback. I looked at amazon data pertaining to watches. 

### Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

  *How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there? 
    
    *Vine = 43 
    *non-Vine = 7720

  *How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars? 
     
     *Vine = 14 
     *non-Vine = 4018

  *What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars? 
    
    *Vine 33% 
    *non-Vine 52%

### Summary: 
  From what I can see, I don't think there is much of a postivity bias in the Vine program. I think a larger dataset would help prove this, but based on what is shown here, only 33% of those the Vine program gave a 5 star review to the over 50% of non-Vine program that did. Again, the amount of reviewers that participated in the Vine program was so low its almost inconsequential.
